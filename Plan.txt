Phase 1
- Generate simple tileset
    - Game tiles
    - 26 letters
- Draw basic game play
    - Two game tiles
    - A letter over top of each one
        - Open question: Are letters sprites or part of the background
            - Pros to sprites: You can do different color text / game tiles on DMG (two OBJ palettes)
            - Cons to sprites: You are limited to about 32x32px (16 sprites each, 32 total). Maximum 32x36
            - Background could also use different colors, you'd just need to load double the tiles. But if you only load two letters at a time, that could work
- Listen to button press events
- On A button press generate random number
- Link random number to letters and display new, random letters on game tiles

Phase 2
- Improve graphics (if needed)
- Render four players ("Player 1" through "Player 4")
- Use arrow keys to adjust score (up and down navigate between players, left and right adjust score)
- Start button saves game state (just score for now)
- Load game state on game start

Phase 3
- Game Tile flip animation
- Countdown timer
- Add Game Boy Color support
- Add Menu
    - Save Game
    - Reset Scores

Phase 4
- Update menu to include "Edit Player Names"
- Build edit player name interface
- Add player names to save / load

Out of Scope
- Having a dictionary
    - Count of valid answers
    - Check / display valid answers
